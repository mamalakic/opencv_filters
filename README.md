# Filters using computer vision


### Notes 
- Dark png's tend to mess up the masking so they are avoided.
- Code is based off of tutorials found. e.g. https://medium.com/@mohd-uzair/making-face-filters-with-opencv-e3c928865239


## Current features
Cycle filters using 0-9 keys
Debug prints


## TODO
- EMA smoothing for less twitchy filter application
- Fix hat filters. They are generally out of the detected face coords.
- Fix out of bound errors
- More scalable code (have to add case for each new png)
