Haar Features for Face Detection:

Edges, Corners: computed with derivatives etc. (DSP lab)

Load filter. Resize filter. Using gray scale, make filter transparent (play around with threshold)
Find face(s). Get coordinates of face(s).
=> We need a filter for each face.

Dictate ROI for filter placement (depends on the type of filter)

Program is very prone to curvature

For small boxes/distant faces the coefficients make the filters break
